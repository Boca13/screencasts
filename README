These are the caption files in English and in various other languages
for some of the screencasts in my YouTube channel.

http://www.youtube.com/gabor529

Each screencast has its own subdirectory.
In each subdirectory you will find a file called english.sbv
which is the English caption file. It is based on the automatic
transcription that YouTube generates and then it is improved. Hopefully.

Each translation should have its own .sbv file with the name of the
language being the filename.

The name of the translators should be added to this readme file.

If you are interested in translating any of these screencasts,
please get in contact with me so I can list the translator
in this file.
